## 🔧 Configuration

### Battery & Eco-Score Settings

Edit `src/pages/RiderDashboard.jsx`:

```javascript
// Ather Rizta Z Specifications
const BATTERY_SPECS = {
<<<<<<< HEAD
  capacity: 3700, // 3.7 kWh total capacity
  consumption: {
    eco: 33, // Wh/km in eco mode
    normal: 37, // Wh/km in normal mode
    aggressive: 46, // Wh/km in aggressive mode
  },
};

// Battery Alert Thresholds
const BATTERY_CRITICAL = 10; // % - blocks trip start
const BATTERY_LOW = 25; // % - shows warning
const BATTERY_BLOCK = 0; // % - minimum to ride

// Drain Rate Detection
const DRAIN_BASELINE_WH_KM = 37; // Expected consumption (normal mode)
const DRAIN_ALERT_RATIO = 1.2; // 20% above baseline triggers alert
=======
  capacity: 3700,     // 3.7 kWh total capacity
  consumption: {
    eco: 33,         // Wh/km in eco mode
    normal: 37,      // Wh/km in normal mode
    aggressive: 46   // Wh/km in aggressive mode
  }
};

// Battery Alert Thresholds
const BATTERY_CRITICAL = 10;  // % - blocks trip start
const BATTERY_LOW = 25;       // % - shows warning
const BATTERY_BLOCK = 0;      // % - minimum to ride

// Drain Rate Detection
const DRAIN_BASELINE_WH_KM = 37;  // Expected consumption (normal mode)
const DRAIN_ALERT_RATIO = 1.2;    // 20% above baseline triggers alert

```

### Eco-Score Algorithm

Edit `src/utils/ecoScoring.js`:

```javascript
// Eco-Score Weights (must sum to 100)
const WEIGHTS = {
<<<<<<< HEAD
  throttle: 35, // Smooth acceleration importance
  speed: 35, // Speed maintenance importance
  acceleration: 30, // Acceleration smoothness importance
=======
  throttle: 35,      // Smooth acceleration importance
  speed: 35,         // Speed maintenance importance
  acceleration: 30   // Acceleration smoothness importance
>>>>>>> b257bcb57694fe625e2b22f96c3ae73be24d8ab1
};

// Score Ranges
// 90-100: Excellent (🟢)
// 75-89:  Good (🟢)
// 50-74:  Fair (🟡)
// 25-49:  Poor (🟠)
// 0-24:   Critical (🔴)
```

### Environmental Badge Tiers

Edit `src/utils/ecoImpactCalculations.js`:

```javascript
// CO2 Thresholds (kg CO2 saved)
const BADGE_TIERS = {
<<<<<<< HEAD
  seedling: 5, // 🌱 Seedling
  sapling: 25, // 🌿 Sapling
  oak: 100, // 🌳 Oak
  forestGuardian: 500, // 🌲 Forest Guardian
  carbonChampion: 1000, // 🏆 Carbon Champion
};

// CO2 Calculation
const CO2_PER_KM = 0.142; // kg CO2/km (EV vs. petrol)
=======
  seedling: 5,              // 🌱 Seedling
  sapling: 25,              // 🌿 Sapling
  oak: 100,                 // 🌳 Oak
  forestGuardian: 500,      // 🌲 Forest Guardian
  carbonChampion: 1000      // 🏆 Carbon Champion
};

// CO2 Calculation
const CO2_PER_KM = 0.142;   // kg CO2/km (EV vs. petrol)
>>>>>>> b257bcb57694fe625e2b22f96c3ae73be24d8ab1
const CO2_PER_TREE_YEAR = 21; // kg CO2/year (1 tree)
```

### Default Geofences

Edit `src/data/geofences.js`:

```javascript
export const geofences = [
<<<<<<< HEAD
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Home",
    lat: 18.6702,
    lng: 73.7902,
    radiusKm: 0.5,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Office",
    lat: 18.5204,
    lng: 73.8567,
    radiusKm: 0.3,
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: "College",
    lat: 18.6213,
    lng: 73.9121,
    radiusKm: 0.4,
=======
  { 
    id: 1, 
    name: 'Home', 
    lat: 18.6702, 
    lng: 73.7902, 
    radiusKm: 0.5 
  },
  { 
    id: 2, 
    name: 'Office', 
    lat: 18.5204, 
    lng: 73.8567, 
    radiusKm: 0.3

  { 
    id: 3, 
    name: 'College', 
    lat: 18.6213,

    radiusKm: 0.4 
>>>>>>> b257bcb57694fe625e2b22f96c3ae73be24d8ab1
  },
];
```

### Admin Panel Configuration

Access the Admin Panel in the app (requires `VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`):

```
URL: /admin-panel
Password: [Your configured admin password]

Editable Settings:
- Throttle weight (0-100)
- Speed weight (0-100)
- Acceleration weight (0-100)
- Battery critical threshold (%)
- Battery low threshold (%)
- Drain rate baseline (Wh/km)
- Drain alert ratio (multiplier)
```

### Performance Tips

- **Reduce trip history size** if app feels slow (clear old trips)
- **Disable weather alerts** if not needed
- **Limit map zoom level** for better performance
- **Use charging station cache** to reduce API calls
- **Enable browser caching** for faster loads
